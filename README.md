# AlpineGP

_AlpineGP_ is a Python library for **symbolic regression** via _Genetic Programming_.
It provides a high-level interface to the [`DEAP`](https://github.com/cpml-au/deap)
library, including distributed computing functionalities.

Besides solving classical symbolic regression problems involving _algebraic equations_
(see, for example, the benchmark problems contained in the
[SRBench](https://github.com/cavalab/srbench) repository), _AlpineGP_ is specifically
designed to help identifying _symbolic_ models of _physical systems_ governed by **field equations**.
To this aim, it allows to exploit the **discrete calculus** framework defined and implemented in the library
[`dctkit`](https://github.com/cpml-au/dctkit) as a natural and effective language to express physical models
(i.e., conservation laws).

_AlpineGP_ has been introduced in the paper [_Discovering interpretable physical models
with symbolic regression and discrete exterior calculus_](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad1af2),
along with several benchmark problems (heat transfer, linear elasticity, Euler's
elastica). Scripts to reproduce these benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/cpml-au/SR-DEC_Examples).

**Features**:

- distributed computing provided by the [`ray`](https://www.ray.io) library;
- scikit-learn compatible interface;
- hyperparameter configuration via YAML files and optimization via `optuna`;
- support for custom operators (with/without strong-typing);
- benchmark suite (Nguyen and SRBench).

## Installation

Dependencies should be installed within a `conda` environment. We recommend using
[`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) since it is much faster than `conda` at
solving the environment and downloading the dependencies. To create a suitable
environment based on the provided `.yaml` file, use the command

```bash
$ mamba env create -f environment.yaml
```

Otherwise, you can update an existing environment using the same `.yaml` file.

After activating the environment, clone the git repository and launch the following command

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

to install a development version of the library.

Running the tests:

```bash
$ tox
```

Generating the docs:

```bash
$ tox -e docs
```

## Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, cd into the `bench` folder and execute:

```bash
$ ./bench.sh
```

Then, process the results using the `process_results` notebook.

## Usage

Setting up a symbolic regression problem in _AlpineGP_ involves several key steps:

1. Define the functions that return the **prediction** and the **fitness**
   associated to an individual. These functions **must** have at least the following
   arguments in the first three positions:
   - the list of trees to be evaluated by the current worker;
   - the `toolbox` object used to compile the individual trees into callable functions;
   - the dataset features needed for the evaluation of the individuals. The name of the
     argument **must** be `X`.

Additionally, the fourth argument of the **fitness** function **must** be the dataset
labels, called `y`. For unsupervised problems, `None` must be passed as a `y` argument
to the fit method of the regressor, while the `y` argument of the fitness function must
be dropped. Any additional arguments can be set using
the `common_data` argument of the `GPSymbolicRegressor` object (see below).

```python
def predict(individuals_batch, toolbox, X):

    predictions = [None] * len(individuals_batch)

    for i, tree in enumerate(individuals_batch):
        callable, _ = util.compile_individual_with_consts(tree, toolbox)
        # predictions[i] = ...
    # ...
    return predictions

def fitness(individuals_batch, toolbox, X, y):

    fitnesses = [None]*len(trees)

    for i, tree in enumerate(individuals_batch):

        callable, _ = util.compile_individual_with_consts(tree, toolbox)
        # MSE = ...

        # each fitness MUST be a tuple (required by DEAP)
        fitnesses[i] = (MSE,)

    return fitnesses
```

_Optionally_, you can define a `score` function with the same arguments as those of the
fitness function, to compute the score (e.g. $R^2$) of the best model found during the
SR run on a given dataset.

2. Set up and solve the symbolic regression problem. The configuration of the
   `GPSymbolicRegressor` object can be specified via the arguments of its constructor
   (see the API docs), or loaded from a YAML file.

```python
yamlfile = "simple_sr.yaml"
filename = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), yamlfile)

regressor_params, config_file_data = util.load_config_data(filename)

# pset = gp.PrimitiveSetTyped(...)
# pset.renameArguments(ARG0="x")

pset = util.add_primitives_to_pset_from_dict(
    pset, config_file_data["gp"]["primitives"]
)

# define extra common arguments of fitness and predict functions
penalty = config_file_data["gp"]["penalty"]
common_data = {"penalty": penalty}

# ...
# ...

# load datasets...

gpsr = GPSymbolicRegressor(
    pset_config=pset,
    fitness=fitness,
    score_func=score,
    predict_func=predict,
    common_data=common_data,
    print_log=True,
    batch_size=100,
    **regressor_params
)

# run the symbolic regression
gpsr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# compute the prediction on the test dataset given by the best model found during the SR
pred_test = gpsr.predict(X_test)

ray.shutdown()
```

Complete example scripts can be found in the `examples` directory. In particular, the
`simple_sr.py` script may be used as a template/skeleton for defining your symbolic
regression problem.
